# reactRestaurantSite

This is a restaurant site that I have developed similar to the one that that can be found [here](https://github.com/MaazMakrod/restaurantSite), howeve, it is made using React and ReactStrap. To develop this application, redux was used and a json-server has been made to host the data. This allows me to simulate a server which I can fetch the data from. To learn how to install the application or see images of it, keep reading below.

## Installing the Application

Clone the repository and navigate to each of the folders separately using command prompt or terminal. Run the following command once in the directory:

```npm install```

If this does not work, run:

```npm install --force```

Once your node module dependencies have been installed, start your json-server by navigating to the json-server in your command prompt or terminal and running the following command:

```json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000```

Then navigate to your confusion folder in another command prompt or terminal window and run:

```npm start```

The application will load in your default browser!
